Tests:

The plugin pass the bzr selftest except for:

- lock_write: We  can implement  that, but it  seems it  has been
  abandoned in the existing code already in favor of a global lock
  valid for all transports.

- copy_to: We  can implement that,  but a special care  should be
  taken  with aliases  (i.e.  how sure  can  we be  that the  two
  transports are really  on the same server and  that we can really
  delegate the copy to the server).

- test_rmdir_not_empty: We have cheated there. That's bad.

Extensions:

- Looking  at Apache  sources  it appears  that  PATCH have  been
  introduced  in  Apache 1.3.4,  but  only  the  request name  is
  reserved, there is no code to implement it.
