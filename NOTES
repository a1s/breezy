Tests:

The plugin pass the bzr selftest except for:

- lock_write: We  can implement  that, but it  seems it  has been
  abandoned in the existing code already in favor of a global lock
  valid for all transports.

- test_rmdir_not_empty: We have cheated there. That's bad.

Extensions:

- Looking  at Apache  sources  it appears  that  PATCH have  been
  introduced  in  Apache 1.3.4,  but  only  the  request name  is
  reserved, there is no code to implement it.
