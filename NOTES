Tests:

The plugin pass the bzr selftest except for:

- lock_write: We  can implement  that, but it  seems it  has been
  abandoned in the existing code already in favor of a global lock
  valid for all transports.

- test_rmdir_not_empty: We have cheated there. That's bad.

Extensions:

- Looking  at Apache  sources  it appears  that  PATCH have  been
  introduced  in  Apache 1.3.4,  but  only  the  request name  is
  reserved, there is no code to implement it.

Installation example:

<IfModule mod_dav.c>
Alias /bzr /srv/DAV
<Directory /srv/DAV>
	DAV On
	# DirectorySlash tells apache to reply with redirections if
	# directories miss their final '/'. It does not play well with
	# bzr (to they the least) and provide no benefits in our
	# case. So just turn it off.
	DirectorySlash Off
	AuthType Basic
	AuthName bzr
	AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/dav.users
	<LimitExcept GET OPTIONS>
		Require valid-user
	</LimitExcept>
</Directory>
</IfModule>
