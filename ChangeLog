	First succesful  bzr.dev push.  Requires that bzr.dev  allows dirs
	for http.

	* webdav.py:
	(HttpDavTransport):  Renamed from  WebDavTransport,  but there  is
	HttpTransport_urllib and PyCurlTransport so it may change again...
	(HttpDavTransport._set_curl_options): New func, not yet used.
	(HttpDavTransport.mkdir):  Absorbs  data  otherwise  displayed  on
	stdout by libcurl.
	(HttpDavTransport.append): Documents that the position returned is
	the  one *before* the  append takes  place. The  implementation is
	still naive, but at least correct :-)
	(HttpDavTransport.put): Can be called  with a file-like object *or
	a  string* !  Handles the  string case.  Can also  be  called when
	intermediate directories are missing.
	(HttpDavTransport.move): Absorbs  data  otherwise  displayed  on
	stdout by libcurl.
	(HttpDavTransport.delete): Absorbs  data  otherwise  displayed  on
	stdout by libcurl.

 	* NOTES: 
	New file.
	
	* TODO: 
	New file.
