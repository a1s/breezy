	* webdav.py:
	(HttpDavTransport.mkdir,                     HttpDavTransport.copy,
	HttpDavTransport.move,        HttpDavTransport.delete):        Use
	_set_curl_options to unify the use of curl.
	(HttpDavTransport.put): Use _set_curl_options  to unify the use of
	curl. Translate 403 as NoSuchFile too.

	*  webdav.py: Add  more TODOs  and FIXMEs  :-) Put  at  least this
	version passes bzr selftest (except for lock_write and copy_to for
	which need and.or intent is not clear.
	(HttpDavTransport.__init__,         _set_curl_options):        Use
	self.__class__.   We don't want  to change  the super()  call each
	time the class is renamed.
	(mkdir): Quotes should be right. Even in comment, even in jokes:-)
	(HttpDavTransport.copy): New method.
	(HttpDavTransport.put): 204! We expect 204 not 404.
	(HttpDavTransport.move): Raise exceptions on errors.
	(HttpDavTransport.delete):  Horrrrrrible workaround.   Try  to get
	devs advice asap.
	(TestingDAVRequestHandler,  HttpServer_Dav):  First implementation
	of a test server.

	First succesful  bzr.dev push.  Requires that bzr.dev  allows dirs
	for http.

	* webdav.py:
	(HttpDavTransport):  Renamed from  WebDavTransport,  but there  is
	HttpTransport_urllib and PyCurlTransport so it may change again...
	(HttpDavTransport._set_curl_options): New func, not yet used.
	(HttpDavTransport.mkdir):  Absorbs  data  otherwise  displayed  on
	stdout by libcurl.
	(HttpDavTransport.append): Documents that the position returned is
	the  one *before* the  append takes  place. The  implementation is
	still naive, but at least correct :-)
	(HttpDavTransport.put): Can be called  with a file-like object *or
	a  string* !  Handles the  string case.  Can also  be  called when
	intermediate directories are missing.
	(HttpDavTransport.move): Absorbs  data  otherwise  displayed  on
	stdout by libcurl.
	(HttpDavTransport.delete): Absorbs  data  otherwise  displayed  on
	stdout by libcurl.

 	* NOTES: 
	New file.
	
	* TODO: 
	New file.
